       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p> <em>Conditum Paradoxum</em>, also known as <strong>spiced wine</strong>, was a popular beverage to consume during the roman's celebration of Saturnalia. It was valued enough to be included in one of the oldest cookbooks in human history: the <em>Apicius</em>. This cookbook is what is going to be used as a reference in the creation of this ancient beverage. The combination of ingredients should result in a gold, full bodied color with a sweet honey tatse with a scent of ginger and pepper. </p>
