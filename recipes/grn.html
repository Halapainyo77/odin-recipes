        <p>"I like green eggs and ham!" </p>
        <p> "I <strong>do</strong>! I <strong>like</strong> them, Sam-I-am!"</p>
        <p> Hopefully you were as convinved as I was by the rhetorical genius of this mythical creature known as Sam-I-am. Sam takes on an epic quest to convince his neighbor to try these supposedly godly eggs and ham, so if that doesn't convince you to try them; what will?</p>
        <p> Originating from the 1960 Dr Seuss book, green eggs and ham is a dish that is not limited to the fictional world. One can make their own green eggs and ham, and pester their neighbor about it afterwards</p>
