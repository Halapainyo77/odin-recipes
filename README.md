Odin recipes assignment: 
In completing this assignment, I will have created a website on the topic of recipes and will have included absolute and relative links to outside websites and local pages (on my website) on the topic of dish recipes. I also will have included ordered and unordered lists to aid in the creation of dishes, including an emphasis on certain ingredients or steps in making the dish (bold or italics). I also would have included images to show the final product, while also providing an alt attribute to help those using a screen reader. Being able to construct a basic boilerplate would be a given for this assignment.
